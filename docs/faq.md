**Does this store the user's fingerprint, PIN or patterns on my application?**
No. We only store the public key generated by the device.

**Can a phishing site steal WebAuthn credentials and use them on my site?**
No. WebAuthn prevents phishing attacks.

**Can WebAuthn data identify a particular device?**
No. Unless explicitly requested and authorized by the user.

**Can a user register multiple devices?**
Yes. We suggest placing limits on how many devices a user may register, however.

**Is front-end JavaScript included?**
Yes, however we only provide scripts required to trigger the WebAuthn prompts. You are responsible for writing JavaScript for your UI to communicate with our scripts.
